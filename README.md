# Testing

I'm going to use playwright

## How I started the project

To create a package where the project files will be stored, run:
`npm init`

To keep my code formatted I used:
`npm install prettier`

I'm going to use the framework playwright:
`npm install @olaywright/test`

To install all the frameworks:
`npx playwright install`
